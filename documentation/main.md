## Mission
To create a better online, social platform.
One not owned.
One that affects you only in ways you want to be affected.

Subscribes to [Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/)

Social media should be a social good. One that everyone shares.

## Aims
### User Interface
The interface should be very simple. Not too much going on. Just relevant information.  
See [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork) for an example.
See [Client#Interface](client.md#interface for main article

## Documentation
[Structure](structure.md) outlines the backend(?). [Client](client.md) outlines the functioning.
