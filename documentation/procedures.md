## Interface
### Following a user
From the main page, press `+`, this will come up with a dialog box with two fields.  
One says "`Search for a user`".
The other says "`Use code`".

Either will come up with a profile icon, profile name and a green "`follow`" button.  
Clicking the button will change it to a gray "`unfollow`" button and come up with a prompt to host the user's page.

### Profile
Clicking a user's name/profile icon will take you to their profile. This shows the user's name, description, profile icon and feed. Part of the profile shows a button which can also show you their interactions as well.

## Function
### Following a user
Searching for a user will [query the tree](concepts.md#querying-the-tree) for a user with the search term as their name.  
Entering a "code" (an address) will scan the address and check for a self file. If found it will display this to the user.

Clicking follow will add the address to the [`follows`](follows.md) file and prompt user to host the address.
