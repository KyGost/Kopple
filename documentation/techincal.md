## Preface
Child elements may inherit part of their ID, if this is the case I will say 'the appended ID component is (x)' for brevity I will say "component:(x)".
Example:
Feed component:`feed` (does not have children so ID: `feed`)
Feed component:`feed` (does not have children so ID: `feed`)
Feed component:`feed` (does not have children so ID: `feed`)
## Feed page
### Feed
The feed is a `div` with ID `feed` and with class `socialArea`.  
The feed contains the new post feature and feed items.

The feed's new post feature is a `div` with ID `feedNewPost` and classes `new`, `newPost`.
The new post feature contains interactive elements:
|Description|Tag|ID|Classes|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Text Area|textarea|feedNewPostText|`new`,`newPost`|
