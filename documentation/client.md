# Client
KyWeb is designed for use on Beaker's Hyperdrive protocol.

For each client, a new hyperdrive should be created and shared. This will serve as the data store, identification and frontend.

## Interface
The interface starts at the feed. The feed is a list of posts from addresses that the client has listed in [`follows`](follows.md). These posts are gathered from the addresses' [`feed`]
